Hello people!
I'm a 32 year old mechanical engineer from Hamburg/Germany who is interested in informatics.

During my university time I learned to code in Matlab. In the university I programmed some little programms for thermodynamic and mechanical calculations. In my bachelor thesis I wrote some programms for laying up a heatpump for heating a building and calculate the estimate heat the building needs.

During my thesis I realized how much fun programming is for me and I started, some weeks ago, to learn C with the HowToC online tutorial.
